ðŸ§  Machine Learning Model Trainer App

Welcome to the ML Model Trainer App!

This is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to upload their datasets (or use built-in examples) and train machine learning models with automatic preprocessing, evaluation, and predictionsâ€”all without writing a single line of code.

Features

âœ… Upload your own dataset (CSV, TSV, XLSX) or use example datasets like Titanic, Iris, or Tips.

âœ… Automatic detection of regression or classification problem.

âœ… Handles missing data using Iterative Imputer (numeric) and Most Frequent Imputer (categorical).

âœ… Encodes categorical features automatically using Label Encoding.

âœ… Scales features using StandardScaler.

âœ… Supports multiple ML models:

Regression: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Support Vector Regressor

Classification: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Classifier


âœ… Train-test split for model evaluation.

âœ… Shows model performance metrics:

Regression: MSE, RMSE, MAE, RÂ²

Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix


âœ… Download the trained model as a .pkl file.

âœ… Make new predictions interactively.
